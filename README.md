# Cross-Stitch-DMC-replace-colors
Release 15, created by Tin Tran

This script was originally available on the now defunct `gimplearn.net` forums.

Archived version of the forum thread is available here: [Generate Cross Stitch pattern and DMC thread information Script for GIMP](https://web.archive.org/web/20221209152439/https://www.gimplearn.net/viewtopic.php/Generate-Cross-Stitch-pattern-and-DMC-thread-information-Script-for-GIMP?t=519)

I am simply making it available here, as it seems that free and open solutions have been on the decline, with paid software taking over the scene.

## Installation

I tested this on GIMP 2.10.24, some newer versions (2.10.30+) seem to not work anymore.

1. Right-Click and select Save-as: [cross_stitch_tt.py](https://github.com/mitsuami-megane/Cross-Stitch-DMC-replace-colors/raw/main/cross_stitch_tt.py)
2. Save it into: `C:\Users\YourName\AppData\Roaming\GIMP\2.10\plug-ins`
3. Restart GIMP.


## Usage

1. Open any image file.
2. On the top menu, pick Python-Fu/Cross Stitch...
3. Adjust options to your liking, then start the script.
4. Bill of materials and pattern will be available on separate tabs in GIMP.

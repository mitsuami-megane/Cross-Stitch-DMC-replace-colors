# Cross-Stitch-DMC-replace-colors

This script was originally available under the following (now dead) URL:
```
https://www.gimplearn.net/viewtopic.php/Generate-Cross-Stitch-pattern-and-DMC-thread-information-Script-for-GIMP?t=519
```

I am simply making it available here, as it seems that free and open solutions have been on the decline, with paid software taking over the scene.
